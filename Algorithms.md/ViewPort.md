Youâ€™re describing a linear transformation that maps the bi-unit cube

[-1, 1] x [-1, 1] x [-1, 1]

to a screen-aligned cube:

[x, x+w] x [y, y+h] x [0, d]

âœ… Given Matrix:

Letâ€™s write your matrix M explicitly:

M =

w/2      0       0       x + w/2 
0        h/2     0       y + h/2 
0        0       d/2     d/2     
0        0       0       1

This matrix is applied to homogeneous vectors Vec(i, j, k, 1) in [-1,1]^3.

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Transform bi-unit cube to screen cube

Mapping Each Axis:
	â€¢	X axis:
	â€¢	Input: i in [-1, 1]
	â€¢	Output: xâ€™ = (w/2) * i + (x + w/2)
	â€¢	So:
	â€¢	When i = -1 => xâ€™ = x
	â€¢	When i = +1 => xâ€™ = x + w
	â€¢	Y axis:
	â€¢	Input: j in [-1, 1]
	â€¢	Output: yâ€™ = (h/2) * j + (y + h/2)
	â€¢	So:
	â€¢	When j = -1 => yâ€™ = y
	â€¢	When j = +1 => yâ€™ = y + h
	â€¢	Z axis:
	â€¢	Input: k in [-1, 1]
	â€¢	Output: zâ€™ = (d/2) * k + (d/2)
	â€¢	So:
	â€¢	When k = -1 => zâ€™ = 0
	â€¢	When k = +1 => zâ€™ = d

âœ… Conclusion

This matrix scales and translates the bi-unit cube into the screen-aligned box:
	â€¢	X: maps from [-1, 1] â†’ [x, x + w]
	â€¢	Y: maps from [-1, 1] â†’ [y, y + h]
	â€¢	Z: maps from [-1, 1] â†’ [0, d]

Hence, the matrix you wrote is the affine transformation that maps:

[-1,1]^3 --> [x,x+w] x [y,y+h] x [0,d]

Itâ€™s the composition of:
	1.	A scale by {diag}(w/2, h/2, d/2)
	2.	A translation by (x + w/2, y + h/2, d/2)

This is very common in 3D graphics to transform normalized device coordinates (NDC) into screen space.
